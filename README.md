# AMEO-dataset-EDA
Problem Statement

The AMEO dataset presents an opportunity to analyze the factors influencing salary levels among job seekers. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can help both job seekers and employers make informed decisions regarding salaries and career development strategies.

Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the AMEO dataset to understand the main drivers behind salary disparities among job seekers. By examining factors such as education, skills, location, and experience, we aim to identify key trends and correlations that contribute to variations in salary levels.

Key Objectives

1.Discover Salary Patterns: Explore salary distributions across different job titles and cities to identify any significant trends or patterns.
2.Investigate Influential Factors: Investigate the connections between education, gender, job title, skills, experience, and other personal attributes, and their impact on salary levels.
3.Validate Findings: Support our observations and hypotheses with statistical analysis to ensure the reliability and validity of our conclusions.

Overall Observations

Job Placements: Bangalore, Noida, Hyderabad, and Pune are preferred for job placements, with Mumbai and Kolkata being less favored.
Gender Distribution: The dataset shows an imbalance in gender representation.
Educational Background: B.Tech graduates are predominant, with fewer M.Sc(Tech) graduates.
Graduation Years: Highest number of graduates in 2013, closely followed by 2014 and 2012.
Salary Distribution: Right-skewed, with similar distributions below 10 lakhs.
Specializations: Similar median salaries; CS/EC specializations earn higher.
Designations: Software Engineering is common; males dominate.
Role-Based Pay: Senior software engineers earn the most; females in Test Engineer roles earn more than males.
Experience vs. Salary: Median salaries peak around 3.5-5 lakhs; skewed tenure distribution.
Gender Disparity: Differences in median experience, inconclusive evidence for salary differences solely due to experience.

EDA Steps
1.Data Collection: Gather the dataset from relevant sources.
2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3.Exploratory Analysis: Examine summary statistics and distributions.
4.Relationship Exploration: Investigate correlations and patterns between variables.
5.Visualization: Create visual representations of the data.
6.Insights and Conclusions: Document findings and draw insights.

Data Description

The dataset contains employment outcomes of engineering graduates as dependent variables (Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations) along with standardized scores from cognitive skills, technical skills, and personality skills. It also includes demographic features and contains around 40 independent variables and 4000 data points.

Conclusion

Through this EDA, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform decisions related to salary negotiations, career paths, and recruitment strategies. By understanding the factors influencing salary levels, both job seekers and employers can optimize their approaches for mutual benefit.
